Deliverable 1 Prep
==================
##Description - Chazz
This will be a brief description of the project, as described in the deliverable 1 description. I think we should probably all look over it after and see what we think, and edit it up to a good standard as a group.
##Risks - Markus, Ian, Stephen, Graeme
Each of us will have to identify a risk and create either an action or contingency plan for that risk. Remember that at least one of our risks has to have an action and at least one has to have a contingency plan.
##Meeting Agenda/Minutes - Jordan
As far as I can tell this is just literally including the agenda and minutes of our "second" meeting (I'm not sure if this is still applicable, since this deliverable was probably supposed to be due before the client meeting since it's #1? Maybe ask Janice?). This is actually the biggest section of the grade for this assignment, so probably a slightly more thorough agenda + minutes should be prepared.
##Group Members - Colin
Compile the photos, info, and roles of each member of the group. Fairly straightforward, I think.
