Suggestions / Brainstorm
========================
Add any good ideas for risks, or concerns about any of the other sections here.
##


Risk : Management has changed and decided to support a different OS.

Risk : The client decides to change what a user is responsible for and able to do. For example, it is desired that the Admin Assistant should now also be able to alter grades.
Action plan : Implementing permissions/tasks users can perform will be done modularly. Thus they can be more easily added to or removed from each user.
