\subsection{Login}

\subsection{Landing Page}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UIMockups/pngs/LandingPage}
The Landing Page is shown to all users of the system following login.  The Tasks
box shows actions that each user can do.  It does not show actions the user
cannot do. The above represents what an Instructor would see upon logging in.

\subsection{Manage Courses}

\subsection{Modify Courses}

\subsection{Create/Modify Activity (Detailed)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Log in to the system as an Instructor.
  \item The following screen will be shown.  Press the \textbf{Assignment Management} button.
  \begin{center} 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UIMockups/pngs/LandingPage}
  \end{center}
  \item The following screen will be shown. Select the \textbf{New Activity} button.
  \begin{center}
  NEED A SCREEN FOR THIS
  \end{center}
  \item The following screen will be shown.
   \begin{center} 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UIMockups/pngs/newActivity}
  \end{center}
  To create the activity, complete the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Enter a name for the activity in the \textbf{Name} text field by clicking on 
  it and typing it in.
  \item Select the type of the activity from the \textbf{Type} drop down box.
  This can be an Essay, a Problem Set, or a Programming activity.
  \item Enter a description for the activity by clicking on the \textbf{Description} 
  text field and typing it in.
  \item Enter the language of the activity by clicking on the \textbf{Language} text
  field and typing it in. This can be either a spoken language such as English 
  for an Essay or Problem Set, or a programming language such as Java for a Programming
  activity.
  \item Click on the appropriate radio to make it an \textbf{Individual} or 
  \textbf{Group} activity. If \textbf{Group} is chosen, type in the group size in the 
  adjacent field.
  \item Enter the date and time the activity is due in the \textbf{Due Date} fields 
  in the Year, Month, Day format, followed by the time it is due on that due in the 24-hour 
  format. The default time is 23:59.
  \item A solution can be attached by clicking the \textbf{Attach Solution} button and 
  selecting the desired file from the Explorer window. Alternatively, the path can be 
  typed directly into the adjacent field.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The following is how the New Activity screen could look with some additional options. 
 \begin{center} 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UIMockups/pngs/newActivityDetailed}
  \end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Clicking \textbf{Add Due Date} adds new fields to add an additional date that can 
  be before or after the original due date. The new date can be entered in the same manner 
  as as above. The extra field is the multiplier for penalties/bonuses. For example, 
  entering "75" is equivalent to a 25\% penalty, and entering "110" would be equivalent 
  to a 10\% bonus.
  \item The option \textbf{Attach Test Input/Output} becomes available if \textbf{Type} 
  is set to \textbf{Programming}. This functions exactly as \textbf{Attach Solution}.
 \end{enumerate}
  
\end{enumerate}

and the \textbf{Diff}.
The three windows can be docked together (tabbed) or positioned that each
window takes up $\frac{1}{3}$ of the screen space.
The \textbf{Diff} window intelligently shows the difference between
solution and submitted code.

    appear when completed.
  \item Restore Database
