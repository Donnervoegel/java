\section{Product Overview}  % 5 Marks
The Donnervögel Streamlined Grading System is a powerful tool designed to 
expediate university-level activity grading. Our tool works to minimise the effort 
required for instructors and teaching assistants to grade all types of activities, 
from essays to mathematical problem sets to coding and programming assignments,
and also to minimise the effort required to maintain a central grading system. The 
SGS has been designed from the ground up to meet the needs of universities and 
to simplify the process required for grading. Features of the program include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easy-to-use interface that simplifies the process of grading for everyone
    involved in it.
  \item Separation of users by role, wherein:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item System administrators handle intimate details of the system (backups and
	accounts).
      \item Administrators have access to all the course-related details of the system.
      \item Assistant administrators handle creation, modification, and deletion of the
	courses in the system.
      \item Instructors manage their courses, creating and editing activities.
        In the full version of the software, student group and TA/TM management
        will also be included. Instructors can also grade any activities in their
        class, or edit any grades as they see fit.
      \item Teaching assistants or tutor markers have the ability to mark any students'
	work assigned to them by the instructor.
    \end{itemize}
  \item An atomic structure, where each user has access to only the features they 
    \emph{should} have access to.
  \item Simple, rubric-based marking, where the instructor creates a rubric upon which
    a marker simply enters values corresponding to the rubric's details. This creates
    a consistent marking criteria that is also easy to use.
  \item Support for various types of assignments. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Essays and problem sets submitted to the system in $.pdf$ format can be 
	viewed alongside the rubric for simultaeneous viewing and marking, and easily 
	commented using a propriertary editor. 
      \item Coding assignments in $Python$ are also supported, and students' submitted
	can be viewed and marked alongside the rubric. In addition, a built in testing
	suite feature can run student code and compare its solutions to those of an
	inputted solution file, showing differences to allow easy marking of code
	output.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{../images/UIMockups/pngs/loginScreen}}
The login screen is displayed whenever the program is started, so the user can login
to their own account. The user will enter their username and password into the
appropriate field and hit the Login button. If the details entered were correct,
they will be sent to the landing page, and otherwise an error will be shown telling
the user their details were incorrect.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{../images/UIMockups/pngs/forgotPW}}
If the user hits the Forgot Password button, a pop up window will open prompting
them to enter their username. Once they confirm their username, the System 
Administrator will be alerted to their request for a password reset.
