\section{Product Overview}  % 5 Marks
The Donnervögel MarkShark Grading System is a powerful tool designed to 
expedite university-level activity grading. Our tool works to minimise the effort 
required for instructors and teaching assistants to grade all types of activities, 
from essays to mathematical problem sets to coding and programming assignments,
and also to minimise the effort required to maintain a central grading system.
MarkShark has been designed from the ground up to meet the needs of universities and 
to simplify the process required for grading. Features of the program include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easy-to-use interface that simplifies the process of grading for everyone
    involved in it.
  \item Separation of users by role, wherein:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item System administrators handle intimate details of the system (backups and
	accounts).
      \item Administrators have access to all the course-related details of the system.
      \item Assistant administrators handle creation, modification, and deletion of the
	courses in the system.
      \item Instructors manage their courses, creating and editing activities.
        In the full version of the software, student group and TA/TM management
        will also be included. Instructors can also grade any activities in their
        class, or edit any grades as they see fit.
      \item Teaching assistants or tutor markers have the ability to mark any students'
	work assigned to them by the instructor.
    \end{itemize}
  \item An atomic structure, where each user has access to only the features they 
    \emph{should} have access to.
  \item Simple, rubric-based marking, where the instructor creates a rubric upon which
    a marker simply enters values corresponding to the rubric's details. This creates
    a consistent marking criteria that is also easy to use.
  \item Support for various types of assignments. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Essays and problem sets submitted to the system in $.pdf$ format can be 
	viewed alongside the rubric for simultaneous viewing and marking, and easily 
	commented using a proprietary editor. 
      \item Coding assignments in $Python$ are also supported, and students' submitted
	can be viewed and marked alongside the rubric. In addition, a built in testing
	suite feature can run student code and compare its solutions to those of an
	inputted solution file, showing differences to allow easy marking of code
	output.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  \item The following screen will be shown.
    Press the \textbf{Assignment Management} button.
  \begin{center} 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UpdatedUIScreens/landinginstructor}
  \end{center}
  \item The following screen will be shown.  Select the course that you wish
    to do make an activity for from the drop-down list, then press \textbf{Ok}.
    \begin{center} 
      \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UpdatedUIScreens/CourseSelection}
    \end{center}
  \item The following screen will be shown.  Students are listed down the left
    side. Available activities are listed along the top.  Find the student you
    wish to mark for, and select the corresponding activity, then press \textbf{Ok}.
  \begin{center} 
     \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UpdatedUIScreens/MarkingActivitySelection}
  \end{center} 
  \item The following screen will be shown.
   \begin{center} 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{../images/UpdatedUIScreens/ActivityCreation}
   \label{newActivity}
  \end{center}
  To create the activity, complete the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Enter a name for the activity in the \textbf{Name} text field by clicking on 
  it and typing it in.
  \item Select the type of the activity from the \textbf{Type} drop down box.
  This can be an Essay, a Problem Set, or a Programming activity.
  \item Enter a description for the activity by clicking on the \textbf{Description} 
  text field and typing it in.
  \item Enter the language of the activity by clicking on the \textbf{Language} text
  field and typing it in. This can be either a spoken language such as English 
  for an Essay or Problem Set, or a programming language such as Java for a Programming
  activity.
  \item Click on the appropriate radio to make it an \textbf{Individual} or 
  \textbf{Group} activity. If \textbf{Group} is chosen, type in the group size in the 
  adjacent field.
  \item Enter the date and time the activity is due in the \textbf{Due Date} fields 
  in the Year, Month, Day format, followed by the time it is due on that due in
  the 24-hour format. The default time is 23:59.
