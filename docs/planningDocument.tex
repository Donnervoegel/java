\section{Project Overview}
This project is a prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of a grading system.
There will be users of this system: System Administrators, Academic Administrators,
Administrative Assistants, Instructors,  and TA/TM markers.\\
Roles:
\begin{itemize}
  \item System Administrator
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Responsible for the creation and management of accounts, program
       installation, and system backups/restores.
     \item Also manages the system log, which records all activities done by the
       grading system.
   \end{itemize}
   \item Academic Administrator
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Responsible for overseeing the grading system and changing grades
         in the case of a grade dispute, if necessary.
       \item Also manages the Academic Log, which records all grading changes
         in the system.
     \end{itemize}
   \item Administrative Assistant
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Responsible for the creation of courses (including the copying
         and deletion of courses)
     \end{itemize}
   \item Instructor
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Responsible for the creation of management of activities within
         the courses they are teaching.
       \item Responsible for the management of students, student groups, and
         assigning TAs to assignments and student groups.
       \item May also grade activities within their courses.
     \end{itemize}
   \item TA/TM
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Primary graders for the assignments and students assigned to them
         by the Instructor of the course.
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Planning}
\subsection{Risk Management}
\subsubsection{External Library Issues}
The usage of any external libraries of code in our project presents a risk.\\
Scenario: Portions of the project that we might plan to use external libraries
for are not applicable or will not properly function in our project as
we expect.\\
Action Plan: An action plan to eliminate this risk is to minimise any reliance
on external libraries as much as possible. In addition to this, we can also
find multiple libraries that might work for any components requiring an external
library, so as to have backups in the case of any unforeseen incompatibilities
or issues.

\subsubsection{Client OS Change}
Scenario: Management has changed and decided to support a different OS.\\
Action Plan: To keep our budget low for our prototype, coding in java has many
benefits to creating something time efficient and also cross platform.
As such, it is important for our prototype to consider older java libraries
compared to newly updated ones so, in the case of where the client has changed
to a different OS with different java version support, it would be minimal
effort to convert our prototype to one that matches for our client.
\subsubsection{User Specification Change}
Scenario: The client has decided to change what a user will be allowed to do, e.g.
they want an Administrative Assistant to be able to grade as well.\\
Action Plan: An action plan to reduce the impact of this risk is to implement
tasks users can perform as modularly as possible. This will ease the addition or
removal of functions.

\subsubsection{Government/International Regulations Change}
Scenario: Powers greater than the client changed parameters of the project.\\
Contingency Plan: One way to recover from such an unexpected twist is to 
notify the client that circumstances have changed, which may or may not 
delay the final product.  Additionally, a small new team may be hired to 
make the necessary conversions instead of diverting core employees already 
working on the project, if the required changes are non-trivial and time is 
an important issue.  Else the standard management plan should have provided 
time and resources for minor hiccups, and they could be applied here.

 of the group.
\item Colin will create the LaTeX document skeleton, complete with 
format templates. Content can be added and pushed to
 the document through GitHub.
\item As a closing remark, we added the link to the Google Doc the useful
 links section for future reference.
