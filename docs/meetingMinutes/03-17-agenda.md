### General coding guidelines(Use Java 8):
- Follow as much as possible prototype requirements in terms of content
- Variables are declared using only lowercase and underscores if a space is needed
- Variable visibility: All variables will be private, except in special cases(interface classes).  Methods should be public unless they are helpers used only in that class.
- Variables in looping should be a single, lowercase character such as (i,j,k).  The default start character is 'i', if more nesting is needed move down the alphabet.  Constants should be notated in all CAPS.
- Getters and Setters should be formatted in the style of the getters/setters  generated automatically through Eclipse
- Comments: Don't comment unnecessarily but if unsure, stray to the side of more comments vs less.
- Methods: For the first word in each method, use lowercase.  For every subsequent use uppercase.  No matter how small the word is (Of, Is, To), follow the  guidelines.  No spaces between words.
- Classes: Capitalize every word, no spaces.
- Constructors: Always put the constructor between fields and other methods.
- Use iterative loops instead of manual loops ( where possible)
- Use Eclipse's style of formatting (ie. curly brace placement, tabbing)
