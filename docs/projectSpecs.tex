A TA/TM has access to and only to the assignments of the groups or students they
have been assigned, for both grading and regrading.

\section{The Login System}
\subsection{Failed Logins \label{loginSystem1}}
Users are granted five attempts to log in successfully.  If they incorrectly
enter their password all five times, their account is locked and they must reset
their password with the system administrator before they can login again.
\subsection{Password Resets \label{loginSystem2}}
If a user wants to reset their own password(without the help of the System
Administrator) they may ask the system to reset their password.  The system will
send a randomly generated password to their email that they can use to login
until they choose to change their own password.

\subsubsection{Summary Use Case: Marking an Activity}

% \textbf{Functional Requirement} \ref{}

\textbf{Primary Actors:} Instructors, TA/TM Markers \\
\textbf{Secondary Actors:} Database \\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Network is running.
\item Marker is a valid marker and logged in.
\item Initial welcome screen displayed containing options available to Marker.
\item The assignment, rubric and course exist
\item User is marking an assignment they are associated with
\item Database is functional
\end {itemize}

\textbf{Main Flow of Events:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The use case starts when the Marker selects the Marking tab
\item The marker selects a course from the selection they are provided, which then redirects them to a new page for a list of assignments available.
\item The marker selects the assignment they want to mark on which is organized by submission of group/student. 
\item The marker views the assignment, and enters the following data:
	\begin {enumerate}
	\item “Grade”
		\begin {enumerate}
			\item  The user inputs the grade directly into the appropriate section of the rubric.
		\end {enumerate}
	\end {enumerate}
\item The Marker clicks the ‘Save’ button to update the database with the changes they have just made.
\item The system checks that the input data is in correct format (a number greater than or equal to 0).
\item A message is displayed stating that the mark has been successfully added.
The use case terminates after the message has been closed by the “OK” button.
\end {enumerate}

\textbf{Postconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item System saves the mark to the database
\item System returns to the marker’s initial screen
\end {itemize}

\textbf{Exceptional Flow of Events:}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \underline {Invalid mark entered:} If the marker enters non-conformable values for the mark (a mark that is less than 0 or empty) and presses save then:
	\begin {itemize}
		\item The system displays a message stating the mistake.
		\item The marker correct their mistake
		\item The marker selects “save”
		\item The use case continues in the normal fashion starting from step 6.
	\end {itemize}
\item \underline {No submission found:}
If the marker clicks onto an assignment that has not been submitted, then the system displays a message stating the mistake and returns the user back to the same page after closing the message tab.

\item \underline {Changes not saved:} If the marker has made changes but clicks ‘back’ or’’next’ without clicking ‘save’, the user will be offered a prompt asking if they would like to save their changes or move on without saving.
\item \underline {If no more submissions are available :} If the marker clicks ‘next’ and there is no further submissions available to mark, then:
\begin {itemize}
	\item The system displays a message stating the situation.
	\item The system takes the user back to the assignment selection page, ready for any further modifications
	\item The user can continue to select any assignment for remarking or can leave the page by pressing “back”
\end {itemize}

\item \underline {Lost connection:} If the marker’s client program loses connection to the database, then: 
\begin {itemize}
\item The system displays a message stating the connection is lost.

\section{Scenarios}
\subsection{Grade and Save Changes}
Instructor Lee logs in, navigates to his Marking tab, then selects the course MATH 151.
He selects the student Mary’s submission for Homework 3, which was a series of multiple
choice math questions. He checks Mary’s submitted answers side-by-side with the solutions.
There were 20 questions worth 1 point each and Mary had 18 correct, so Instructor
Lee enters 18 into the points received portion of the rubric. He then clicks Save to update
the database, and it saves successfully.

\subsection{Grade and Discard Changes}
TA Jane logs in, navigates to her marking tab, then selects the course PHIL 100. She
selects the student Bill’s submission for Essay 2. The pdf of the essay is opened and
its rubric is shown beside it. Halfway through marking the essay and having already
filled in the marks for half of the rubric’s criteria, Jane realizes she had been repeatedly
misreading some key words and it changed the meaning of most of the essay. She decides
to regrade the entire essay, so she clicks on Discard Changes. A dialogue window pops
up that asks “You are going to discard changes. All unsaved changes will be lost. Are you
sure you want to continue?” with the options yes and no. She chooses yes and all the
changes she made to the rubric were reset. She now still has the same view, but the
rubric is back to its initial state with no marks entered.

\subsection{Comment on Code and Save Changes}
Instructor Lee logs in, navigates to his Marking tab, then selects the course CMPT 120.
He selects the student Ned’s submission for Code Assignment 4, which is a short Java
program. The code submission is presented in a text-editable box and the rubric is shown
beside it. As he is marking, Instructor Lee notices some portions of the code could have
been written more efficiently, so he enters a Java comment directly into the code which
suggests a possible improvement. He clicks Save which saves all the marks he had input
into the rubric, and also saves the updated code with his comments. A copy of the student’s
original submission still exists, but there is now also a copy which includes Instructor Lee’s
comments. Instructor Lee’s view is now still of the commented submission and the rubric with
the marks that have already been entered.
