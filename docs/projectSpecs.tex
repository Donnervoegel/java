\section{The Muffin Man}
\subsection{Making Muffins}
There is much to consider when making muffins.
\subsubsection{Choosing the Right Ingredients}
Any Muffin Man knows the right selection of bacon can make or break a good
muffin. Basically you can type whatever you want here and LaTeX will format it
nicely for you.
\subsubsection{Mixing}
Put your back into it.
\subsubsection{Into the Oven}
Preheat your oven to $\frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}e^i$ degrees.
\subsection{Sellings Muffins}
\subsubsection{Presentation}
Ugly looking muffins won't get bought.
\subsubsection{A Good Store Front}
People won't come into a shady looking place, no matter how good your muffins are.
\subsubsection{On Wit and Charm}
When all else fails, hope you rolled a good CHA stat, and be a gentleman.
