	\item The instructor will modify the rubric of a selected activity from the course.
	\item If the rubric of an activity is modified where grading has already done, the 
		activity must be completely regraded.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Add tests (coding activities) \label{addTests}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The instructor will add tests for a coding assignment.
	\item The tests can include some test inputs for the student's code to be run on.

A particular student's or group's assignment can be selected so the rubric is
shown side by side during grading.
\subsubsection{Enter Grades}
Markers are able to enter grades directly into the rubric while they are viewing
the assignment and rubric side by side.
\subsubsection{Add Comments to Student Work}
\begin {itemize}
	\item For PDF submissions, markers are able to add comments directly into the PDF.
	\item For code submissions, comments will be added directly to the code via the Test Suite
and the commented version saved separately, also leaving a copy of the original.
\end {itemize}
\subsubsection{Test Code Activities}
The Test Suite will compile and run code assignments through the submitted tests,
then present the outputs side by side with the sample correct outputs.

\section{Role - The TA/TM Markers \label{Marker}}
\subsection{Grade Activities}
The same as the Grade Activities section \ref {grading} under the Instructor.
A TA/TM has access to and only to the assignments of the groups or students they
have been assigned, for both grading and regrading.

\section{The Login System}
\subsection{Failed Logins \label{loginSystem1}}
Users are granted five attempts to log in successfully.  If they incorrectly
enter their password all five times, their account is locked and they must reset
their password with the system administrator before they can login again.
\subsection{Password Resets \label{loginSystem2}}
If a user wants to reset their own password(without the help of the System
Administrator) they may ask the system to reset their password.  The system will
send a randomly generated password to their email that they can use to login
until they choose to change their own password.

\section{The Database}
\subsection{Content}
The database is responsible for storing:
\begin{itemize}
\item User Accounts
\item Courses
\item Activities
\item Rubrics
\item Grades
\end{itemize}

\section{Logs}
There are two distinct types of logs: Academic Logs and System Logs.
\subsection{Academic Logs}
The academic log contains all records of additions and changes to the academic records.
The academic log documents grade and assignment modifications.  The academic log
is visible to every user excluding the TA/TM marker.
\subsection{System Logs}
The system log contains a record of the systems tasks.  It documents user sign-ins
and system backup times. The system log is only visible to the System Administrator.

can be performed.
\subsection{Navigation}
Any page of the application will have a means to go back to the previous
page visited.

\section{Login}
\begin{tabular}{| p{5cm} | p{5cm} | p{5cm} |}
	\hline
	Inputs & Outputs & Data Displayed \\ \hline
	Username of user \newline Password of user \newline Enter button \newline Forgot 
	Password button & If user enters correct username and password, they will be sent 
	to their respective home screen. \newline If the user selects the forgotten password 
	option they will be sent to a screen with a process for resetting passwords. & Upon 
	hitting enter, an error will be displayed if the username and password are not valid.
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Description}
The login will be the first screen shown upon opening the program. The login screen 
satisfies the separation of the functional requirements by role, as well as the
password locking after failed attempts and password resetting as specified in
sections \ref{loginSystem1} and \ref{loginSystem2} on page \pageref{loginSystem1}.

\section{Activity Marking}
\subsection{Inputs}
\subsubsection{Grade Inputs}
Beside each entry will be an
area for the Marker to add a grade for that part of the rubric.
\subsubsection{Comment Insertion}
The user can insert comments directly into student work.
\subsubsection{Return Activity Button}
There will be a button available to deliver a commented copy of the working
assignment back to the student.
\subsection{Outputs}
\subsubsection{Rubric Display}
All entries for the rubric will be shown.
Total grade will be calculated based on the above entries and shown at the
bottom.
\subsubsection{Student Work Display}
The student work will be visible beside the rubric and grade entry areas.
\subsection{Description}
This screen allows users with Marking privileges to grade student activities
as described in section \ref{grading} on page \pageref{grading}.\\
The user navigates here from \textbf{Course Choice} then \textbf{Activity Choice}.

\section{Account Creation/Modification}
\subsection{Inputs}
There will be fields to input the neccessary information described
in section \ref{Account Creation} on page \pageref{Account Creation}.
\subsection{Outputs}
After checking to ensure that all fields are filled out, the user is 
prompted with a confirmation of the fields. After confirming, the user 
is returned to the System Admin home screen.
\subsection{Description}
The same screen is used for modifying an account. The only difference is
that the fields are filled with the previous data of the existing account.
\section{Course Creation}
\subsection{Inputs}
There will be fields open to the user to input the neccessary information described
in section \ref{courseCreation} on page \pageref{courseCreation}.
\subsection{Outputs}
Once the input has been finalized with a submission button, the output will return
the user back to the course management system for other options.
\subsection{Description}
When creating the course, the screen will be the same as the function in section
\ref{modifying} Modifying an Existing course, but the fields will be empty.
When choosing the "create a Course" function, it will directly send you to this screen.

\section{Activity Creation/Modification}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | }
	\hline
	Inputs & Outputs & Other Displayed \\
	& & Values \\ \hline
	-Fields for data entry or buttons that lead
	& -Activities being edited will have the
	& None \\
	to more in-depth entry for all points listed &  current information shown in the & \\
	under \ref{ActivityManagement} Activity Management on page
	\pageref{ActivityManagement}, & appropriate field & \\
	except for a list of student grades & -Activities being created from scratch & \\
	& will have each field empty & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Description}
Both activity creation and modification share virtually the same screen.
When an option would not be applicable for the activity, such as test input and
output files for non-programming activities, the field will not be shown.
This screen satisfies the requirements \ref{CreateAct} and \ref{ModifyAct} for
an Instructor to create and modify activities.

\section{Test Suite}
\subsection{Inputs}
The only inputs the test suite would take would be comments to place in the
submitted code as well as the user input needed to interact with the console
output of the submitted code.
\subsection{Outputs}
The test suite would output to the screen the reference code, the submitted code
and the console messages.
\subsection{Description}
The test suite screen contains both the reference code and the student submitted
code in a side by side format.  It includes a section for the marker to view
and interact with the output of the submitted code.  The test suite also allows
markers to add comments directly to the submitted code.  The test suite is a
side-by-side code marking system, as well as marker interaction with the
submitted code which satisfies the functional requirement described in section
\ref{grading} on page \pageref{grading}.

\section{Student/TA Group Management}
The TA Management Screen allows the instructor to (re)assign students to TA's.
\subsection{Inputs}
The user will be presented with three lists: all the TA's in the course and all
students enrolled in the course, along with all activities.  TA's, students, and
activities can be selected, along with respective Select All and Select None
buttons.  There will also be a few buttons to relate TA's and students:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assign TA
  \item Default Split
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outputs}
\subsubsection{Assign TA}
Groups all selected students with the selected TA.
\subsubsection{Default Split}
Chunks all selected students (or all enrolled, if none are specified) by name,
then assign equal sized groups to each selected TA (or all available, if none
are specified).  This also fills the role of assigning all students to one TA
if there is only one TA for the course.
\subsubsection{Result}
The result of the selected operation will be displayed afterwards, saying whether
the process was successful or an error occurred.
\subsection{Description}
This UI page satisfies the functional requirements outlined in \ref{AssignTA}
on page \pageref{AssignTA}.
