\subsubsection{Modifying a Rubric}
Modifying the rubric of an activity after it has been marked requires the whole
activity to be re-marked.

\subsubsection{WHAT DOES THIS MEAN}
An Admin. Assistant can fetch the latest list of students registered in a
specific course through the Course Management System.
When inputting the list of the students into the course, the course management
system will check for any updates from the previous list with the new one,
making any necessary additions or removal of students.

\subsubsection{Deleting a course}
An admin assistant is able to delete any existing course.


\section{Role - The Instructor}

\part{Prioritization of Function Requirements}

% --------------------------------
\part{Non-functional Requirements}
\section{Quality}
\subsection{Usability}
The application should be usable to all relevant university staff
regardless of computer experience.
\subsection{Accessibility}
\subsubsection{Valid Users}
Only users who have created an account with the System Administrator will be able
to use the application. Users will not be able to log in with their normal
university username and password.
\subsubsection{Availability Hours}
The system should be accessible at any time of day, except during backup times.
\subsection{Performance}
\subsubsection{Maximum Load}
The client has specified that up to 20 users might use the system during
peak times, thus the system should aim for no slow-down for up to \textbf{40 users.}
\subsection{Maintenance}
\subsubsection{Application Life Span}
The client has not indicated how long they plan to use the system once developed.
\subsubsection{Addition of Features}
The client has not requested a desire for the addition of new
features post release.

\section{Constraints}
\subsection{Platform}
The application will run on the Windows desktop.
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{Language}
The application will be written in Java using the Swing library for its GUI.
\subsubsection{Development Environment}
Eclipse?
\subsubsection{Version Control}
The source code will be managed via a software version control system.
\subsection{External Resources}
\subsubsection{SQL Database}
The application will store user and grading data on an MS SQL server located on
the university campus, and thus the user's computer must have a network connection.
\subsection{Licensing}
\subsubsection{Closed Source}
The application will be closed source under the Donnervögel Draconian License.
\subsubsection{GPL Incompatibility}
No libraries with GPL licensing will be included in the system.

\section{Other Requirements}
\subsection{System Administration}
\subsubsection{Account Management}
User accounts may only be created through the System Administrator.
\subsubsection{System Backups}
Database backups will be performed by the System Administrator and not handled
through the application.

% -------------------------------
\part{User Interface Description}

\section{General}
\subsection{Layout}
The application will be laid out in pages for each of the multiple tasks that
can be performed.
\subsection{Navigation}
Any page of the application will have a means to go back to the previous
page visited.

\section{Login}
\subsection{Login Screen}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
The login screen will contain inputs for "username" and "password", along with a
button to "enter" (confirm the username and password entered) and a button to handle
forgotten passwords. The username and password will be checked against the login database,
and the forgotten password will invoke some process to reset passwords.
\subsubsection{Outputs}
Upon hitting the "enter" button, the user will either be granted access or denied based
on an incorrect password. If a user is granted access, they will be sent
to a main UI screen offering their account's options in the system. If they enter a wrong
password, they will be told so, and given 5 opportunities to enter the correct password
before their account is locked. If the "forgot password" prompt is hit, the user will be sent
to a separate interface for resetting passwords
\subsection{Description}
The login will be the first screen shown upon opening the program. The login screen 
satisfies the separation of the functional requirements by role, as well as the capacity for users
to reset their passwords.

\section{Marking}
The marking system involves several stages each with its own screen in
the application.
\subsection{Course Choice}
The user is presented with a list of courses they are affiliated with. \\
Only courses in the current term will be shown. The courses themselves
will be buttons or clickable text.
\subsection{Assignment Choice by Student/Group}
The user can select two view styles for this screen. Note that in either case,
assignments not to be graded by the user will not be selectable. Assignments
will be buttons.
\subsubsection{Student View}
The user is presented with a grid of students and assignments. Only students
affiliated with the user will be visible.
\subsubsection{Group View}
The user is presented with a grid of groups and assignments. Only groups
affiliated with the user will be visible.
\subsection{Assignment Grading}
This screen shows all information relavent to the assignment, specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Name of Activity
  \item Type of Activity
  \item Human Language of Activity/Instruction
  \item Programming Language of Activity (if applicable)
  \item Status as Group/Individual Activity (yes/no)
  \item Due date
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rubric Display}
All entries for the rubric will be shown. Beside each entry will be an
area for the Marker to add a grade for that part of the rubric.\\
Total grade will be calculated based on the above entries and shown at the
bottom.
\subsubsection{Assignment Display}
Will the assignment be clearly visible right beside the rubric?
\subsubsection{Return Assignment Button}
There will be a button available to deliver a commented copy of the working
assignment back to the student.

\section{System Admin Maintenance Panels}

\section{Course Creation/Modification}
There will be 4 buttons available, "Adding a course", "Editting existing course" and "Copy a course", "Delete a course".

\subsection{Adding a course}
There will be fields open to the user to input the neccessary information described in ____________3.1: adding a course.

\subsection{Editing an existing course}
Ther will be a list of existing courses for you to choose from. Once the user has picked the course to edit, there will be fields\\
open to the user to make any changes necessary. This satisfies req. #___________:editing existing course.

\subsection{Deleting an existing course}
Ther will be a list of existing courses for you to choose from with checkboxes to satisfy req. #____________:deleting a course.

\section{Activity Creation/Modification}
The view is virtually the same for both creation and modification.
The fields that will be shown for data entry or modification are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Activity name
	\item Due date
	\item Type of activity
	\item Language of activity
	\item Size of group
	\item Rubric
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of expectations
		\item Description for each expectation
		\item Maximum grade for each expectation
	\end{itemize}
	\item Solution
	\item Test input and output files
\end{itemize}

Activities being created from scratch will have each field empty.
When editing, the current information is shown in the appropriate field.
Test input and output files are only an option for code activities.

\section{Test Suite}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The submitted code will be view-able side by side with the solution code.
  \item The code will be compiled on the server in an insulated environment.
