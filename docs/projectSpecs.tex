to use the application. Users will not be able to log in with their normal
university username and password.
\subsubsection{Availability Hours}
The system should be accessible at any time of day, except during backup times.
\subsection{Performance}
\subsubsection{User Base}
The client has specified that there will be around 200 user accounts. Ensure
support of up to \textbf{400 users.}
\subsubsection{Maximum Load}
The client has specified that up to 20 users might use the system during
peak times, thus the system should aim for no slow-down for up to \textbf{40 users.}
\subsection{Maintenance}
\subsubsection{Application Life Span}
The client has not indicated how long they plan to use the system once developed.
\subsubsection{Addition of Features}
The client has not requested a desire for the addition of new
features post release.

\section{Constraints}

The application will run on the Windows desktop.
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{Language}
The application will be written in Java using the Swing library for its GUI.
\subsubsection{Development Environment}
Eclipse and Emacs will be used for code creation.\\
?? will be used for document editing.
\subsubsection{Version Control}
The source code will be managed via a software version control system.
\subsection{External Resources}
\subsubsection{SQL Database}
The application will store user and grading data on an MS SQL server located on
the university campus, and thus the user's computer must have a network connection.
\subsection{Licensing}
\subsubsection{Closed Source}

\part{User Interface Description}

\section{General}
\subsection{Layout}
The application will be laid out in pages for each of the multiple tasks that
can be performed.
\subsection{Navigation}
Any page of the application will have a means to go back to the previous
page visited.

\section{Login}
\subsection{Login Screen}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
The login screen will contain inputs for "username" and "password", along with a
button to "enter" (confirm the username and password entered) and a button to handle
forgotten passwords. The username and password will be checked against the login database,
and the forgotten password will invoke some process to reset passwords.
\subsubsection{Outputs}
Upon hitting the "enter" button, the user will either be granted access or denied based
on an incorrect password. If a user is granted access, they will be sent
to a main UI screen offering their account's options in the system. If they enter a wrong
password, they will be told so, and given 5 opportunities to enter the correct password
before their account is locked. If the "forgot password" prompt is hit, the user will be sent
to a separate interface for resetting passwords
\subsection{Description}
The login will be the first screen shown upon opening the program. The login screen 
satisfies the separation of the functional requirements by role, as well as the capacity for users
to reset their passwords.

\section{Activity Marking}
\subsection{Inputs}
\subsubsection{Grade Inputs}
Beside each entry will be an
area for the Marker to add a grade for that part of the rubric.
\subsubsection{Comment Insertion}
The user can insert comments directly into student work.
\subsubsection{Return Assignment Button}
There will be a button available to deliver a commented copy of the working
assignment back to the student.
\subsection{Outputs}
\subsubsection{Rubric Display}
All entries for the rubric will be shown.
Total grade will be calculated based on the above entries and shown at the
bottom.
\subsubsection{Student Work Display}
The student work will be visible beside the rubric and grade entry areas.
\subsection{Description}
This screen allows users with Marking privileges to grade student activities
as described in section \ref{grading} on page \pageref{grading}.\\
The user navigates here from \textbf{Course Choice} then \textbf{Assignment Choice}.

\section{System Admin Maintenance Panels}
The System Administrator's screens are exclusive to the System Admin
\subsection{Initial Screen}
The user is presented with the following options: 
\emph{Create Account}, \emph{Modify Account}, \emph{View/Manage System Log}, \emph{Manage System Backups}, \emph{Application Installation}
\subsubsection{Create Account}
This page asks for the fields described in **(the requirements for System Admin Account Creation_)** \\
This page also has a button to "confirm creation" button, as well as a "return" button
\subsubsection{Modify Account}
This page is similar to the Create Account page, with the above mentioned fields filled in. \\
The buttons are also similar. There is a "confirm changes" button and a "return" button.
\subsubsection{View/Manage System Log}
This page opens the system log. 
\subsubsection{Manage System Backup}
This page has two buttons, buttons, a "back up now" button, and a "restore" button. \\
The "restore" button will prompt the user for the version s/he wished to restore to.
\subsubsection{Account Installation}
The user will be provided with a .exe file to be used to isntall the application.

\section{Course Creation/Modification}
There will be 4 buttons available, \emph{Add a course}, \emph{Edit existing course},
\emph{Copy a course}, and \emph{Delete a course}.

\subsection{Adding a course}
There will be fields open to the user to input the neccessary information described
in section \ref{courseCreation} on page \pageref{courseCreation}.

\subsection{Editing an existing course}
Ther will be a list of existing courses for you to choose from. Once the user has
picked the course to edit, there will be fields open to the user to make any
changes necessary. This satisfies req.
(SECTION HERE): editing existing course.

\subsection{Deleting an existing course}
There will be a list of existing courses for you to choose from with checkboxes
to satisfy req. (SECTION HERE) deleting a course.

\section{Activity Creation/Modification}
\subsection{Inputs}
The fields that will be shown for data entry or modification are all those listed
under \ref{ActivityManagement} Assignment Management on page \pageref{ActivityManagement} except for a list of student grades.
When an option would not be applicable for the activity, such as test input and output files
for non-programming activities, the field will not be shown.
\subsection{Outputs}
Activities being edited will have the current information shown in the appropriate field.
Activities being created from scratch will have each field empty.
When an option would not be applicable for the activity, such as test input and output files
for non-programming activities, the field will not be shown.
\subsection{Description}
Both activity creation and modification share virtually the same screen.
This screen satisfies the requirements \ref{CreateAct} and \ref{ModifyAct} for an Instructor to create and modify activities.

\section{Test Suite}
\subsection{Test Suite Screen}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
The only inputs the test suite would take would be comments to place in the submitted code as well as the user input needed to interact with the console output of the submitted code.
\subsubsection{Outputs}
The test suite would output to the screen the reference code, the submitted code and the console messages.
\subsection{Description}
The test suite screen contains both the reference code and the student submitted code in a side by side format.  It includes a section for the marker to view and interact with the output of the submitted code.  The test suite also allows markers to add comments directly to the submitted code.  The test suite satisfies for all roles the functional requirement of a side-by-side code marking system, as well as marker interaction with the submitted code.
