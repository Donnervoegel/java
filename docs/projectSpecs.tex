page visited.

\section{Login}
\subsection{Inputs}
The login screen will contain inputs for "username" and "password", along with a
button to "enter" (confirm the username and password entered) and a button to handle
forgotten passwords. The username and password will be checked against the login database,
and the forgotten password will invoke some process to reset passwords.
\subsection{Outputs}
Upon hitting the "enter" button, the user will either be granted access or denied based
on an incorrect password. If a user is granted access, they will be sent
to a main UI screen offering their account's options in the system. If the "forgot password"
 prompt is hit, the user will be sent to a separate interface for resetting passwords
\subsection{Description}
The login will be the first screen shown upon opening the program. The login screen 
satisfies the separation of the functional requirements by role, as well as the password locking
after failed attempts and password resetting as specified in sections \ref{loginSystem1} and
\ref{loginSystem2} on page \pageref{loginSystem1}.

\section{Activity Marking}
\subsection{Inputs}
\subsubsection{Grade Inputs}

\subsubsection{Rubric Display}
All entries for the rubric will be shown.
Total grade will be calculated based on the above entries and shown at the
bottom.
\subsubsection{Student Work Display}
The student work will be visible beside the rubric and grade entry areas.
\subsection{Description}
This screen allows users with Marking privileges to grade student activities
as described in section \ref{grading} on page \pageref{grading}.\\
The user navigates here from \textbf{Course Choice} then \textbf{Assignment Choice}.

\section{System Admin Maintenance Panels}
The System Administrator's screens are exclusive to the System Admin
\subsection{Initial Screen}
The user is presented with the following options: 
\emph{Create Account}, \emph{Modify Account}, \emph{View/Manage System Log}, \emph{Manage System Backups}, \emph{Application Installation}
\subsubsection{Create Account}
This page asks for the fields described in \ref{Account Creation} \\
This page also has a button to "confirm creation" button, as well as a "return" button
\subsubsection{Modify Account}
This page is similar to the Create Account page, with the above mentioned fields filled in. \\
The buttons are also similar. There is a "confirm changes" button and a "return" button.
\subsubsection{View/Manage System Log}
This page opens the system log. 
\subsubsection{Manage System Backup}
This page has two buttons, buttons, a "back up now" button, and a "restore" button. \\
The "restore" button will prompt the user for the version s/he wished to restore to.
\subsubsection{Account Installation}
The user will be provided with a .exe file to be used to isntall the application.

\section{Course Creation}

\subsection{Adding a course}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
There will be fields open to the user to input the neccessary information described
in section \ref{courseCreation} on page \pageref{courseCreation}.
\subsubsection{Outputs}
Once the input has been finalized with a submission button, the output will return the use back to the course management system for other options.
\subsection{Description}
When creating the course, the screen will be the same as the function in section \ref{modifying} Modifying an Existing course, but the fields will be empty. When choosing the "create a Course" function, it will directly send you to this screen.


\section{Activity Creation/Modification}
\subsection{Inputs}
The fields that will be shown for data entry or modification are all those listed
under \ref{ActivityManagement} Assignment Management on page \pageref{ActivityManagement} except for a list of student grades.
When an option would not be applicable for the activity, such as test input and output files
for non-programming activities, the field will not be shown.
\subsection{Outputs}
Activities being edited will have the current information shown in the appropriate field.
Activities being created from scratch will have each field empty.
When an option would not be applicable for the activity, such as test input and output files
for non-programming activities, the field will not be shown.
\subsection{Description}
Both activity creation and modification share virtually the same screen.
This screen satisfies the requirements \ref{CreateAct} and \ref{ModifyAct} for an Instructor to create and modify activities.

\section{Test Suite}
\subsection{Test Suite Screen}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
The only inputs the test suite would take would be comments to place in the submitted code as well as the user input needed to interact with the console output of the submitted code.
\subsubsection{Outputs}
The test suite would output to the screen the reference code, the submitted code and the console messages.
\subsection{Description}
The test suite screen contains both the reference code and the student submitted code in a side by side format.  It includes a section for the marker to view and interact with the output of the submitted code.  The test suite also allows markers to add comments directly to the submitted code.  The test suite is a side-by-side code marking system, as well as marker interaction with the submitted code which satisfies the functional requirement described in section \ref{grading} on page \pageref{grading}.

\section{Student/TA Group Management}
The TA Management Screen allows the instructor to (re)assign students to TA's.
\subsection{Inputs}
The user will be presented with three lists: all the TA's in the course and all students enrolled in the course, along with all activities.  TA's, students, and activities can be selected, along with respective Select All and Select None buttons.  There will also be a few buttons to relate TA's and students:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assign TA
  \item Default Split
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outputs}
\subsubsection{Assign TA}
Groups all selected students with the selected TA.
\subsubsection{Default Split}
Chunks all selected students (or all enrolled, if none are specified) by name, then assign equal sized groups to each selected TA (or all available, if none are specified).  This also fills the role of assigning all students to one TA if there is only one TA for the course.
\subsubsection{Result}
The result of the selected operation will be displayed afterwards, saying whether the process was successful or an error occurred.
\subsection{Description}
This UI page satisfies the functional requirements outlined in \ref{AssignTA} on page \pageref{AssignTA}.
